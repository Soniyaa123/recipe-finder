Juju Dhau (King Yogurt from Bhaktapur)
* Ingredients:
   1. 1 liter buffalo milk (for authentic richness) or full-fat cow's milk
   2. 2-3 tbsp yogurt starter (from a previous batch of yogurt or plain yogurt with live cultures)
   3. 2-3 tbsp sugar (optional, depending on your preference)
   4. Clay pot or earthenware for setting the yogurt (optional, for traditional texture)
* Recipe:
   1. Boil the Milk: Pour the buffalo milk into a deep pan and bring it to a boil. Stir occasionally to prevent the milk from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
   2. Cool the Milk: Once the milk boils, let it cool down to a lukewarm temperature (about 40°C/104°F). To test, dip a clean finger into the milk; it should feel warm but not hot.
   3. Add the Starter: Take 2-3 tablespoons of yogurt starter and mix it gently into the lukewarm milk. Ensure the starter is evenly distributed for a smooth set.
   4. Set the Yogurt: Pour the milk into a clay pot for a traditional setup (optional, but it enhances the flavor and texture) or any clean container. Cover the container with a lid or cloth.
   5. Allow it to Set: Place the container in a warm, undisturbed place for 6-8 hours or overnight. The yogurt will gradually thicken and set into a rich, creamy consistency.
   6. Refrigerate and Serve: Once the yogurt is set, refrigerate it to chill before serving. The creamy, rich flavor of Juju Dhau is perfect as a dessert or a side with traditional Nepali meals.
